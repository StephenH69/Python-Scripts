# Python Scripts
Various scripts I have created for online courses, fun and puzzle solving.

----------

## Basic Site Scraper
Following on from a Udemy course outlining the basics of website scraping I added in extra features such as file checking and path checking. The original version forced the hard coding of the full file paths, my version enables it to be added to any file structure easily as the paths and files are checked first and created if not available.

The course version separated the analytic code from the scraping code, but I wanted a combined system without the need to manually run separate files. After combining them I also added in the export of the main articles list to be exported as a csv file (the original offered json only).

----------

## Pi Calculator
A Pi calculator that give the user three calculation option so they can choose how to calculate pi. They can then choose how many decimal places they want and how many iterations they want the calculation to perform.

----------

## Programmable Web Scraping
Following on from the Udemy course about web scraping, this is a full scraping tool which will collect the basic descriptions of APIs from programmableweb.com.

The next stage of the programme is to create a spider effect which visits the full page and collects the full decription rather than a part description.

### Arrange The Digits (arrange_1to9.py)
A script to help solve a logic problem which was found in a puzzle book

Arrange these digits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 to form:
* a three-digit multiple of three
* a three-digit multiple of four
* a three-digit multiple of five


### Dictionary of Squares (dict_squares.py)
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.

### Guess The Number (guess_the_number.py)
A simple guess the number game. You tell the script the maximum number and it chooses a number within the range zero to the maximum you entered. Then you enter a number and the script tells you if you are too high or too low.


### Nth Term Calculator (nth_term_calculator.py)
Working out the nth term of a sequence was something my kids had trouble with so I developed this script to help them check their answers.




### Palindrome Number (palindrome_numbers.py)
Tells you if a number is a palindrome or not.




### Prime Number Calculator (primes.py)
Calculates the prime numbers between a user input minimum and masimum.



### Rock, Paper, Scissors (rock_paper_scissors.py)
Have a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer.



### Subtraction Sum (subtraction_sum.py)
A script to help solve a logic problem:

Write down a straightforward subtraction sum, A - B = C, where each of the numbers (A, B and C) are made up of nine digits, 1 - 9 inclusive, with each digit being used once only in each number.
