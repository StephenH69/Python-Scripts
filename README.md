# Python Scripts
Various scripts I have created for online courses, fun and puzzle solving.



## Pi Calculator

A Pi calculator that give the user three calculation option so they can choose how to calculate pi. They can then choose how many decimal places they want and how many iterations they want the calculation to perform.



## Arrange The Digits (arrange_1to9.py)
A script to help solve a logic problem:
Arrange these digits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 to form:
*a three-digit multiple of three
*a three-digit multiple of four
*a three-digit multiple of five



## Guess The Number (guess_the_number.py)
A simple guess the number game. You tell the script the maximum number and it chooses a number within the range zero to the maximum you entered. Then you enter a number and the script tells you if you are too high or too low.



## Nth Term Calculator (nth_term_calculator.py)
Working out the nth term of a sequence was something my kids had trouble with so I developed this script to help them check their answers.



## Palindrome Number (palindrome_numbers.py)
Tells you if a number is a palindrome or not.



## Prime Number Calculator (primes.py)
Calculates the prime numbers between a user input minimum and masimum.



## Rock, Paper, Scissors (rock_paper_scissors.py)
Have a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer.



## Subtraction Sum (subtraction_sum.py)
A script to help solve a logic problem:
Write down a straightforward subtraction sum, A - B = C, where each of the numbers (A, B and C) are made up of nine digits, 1 - 9 inclusive, with each digit being used once only in each number.
