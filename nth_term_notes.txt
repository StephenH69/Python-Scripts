There are two types of sequences that you will have to deal with:

Constant Difference Sequences
This is when the difference between terms is always the same.

e.g. 1, 4, 7, 10, ... This has a difference which is always 3.

How do you find the formula for the 'nth' term?

Well, the three times table has the formula '3n' and the terms in this sequence are two less than the terms in the three times table so the formula is '3n - 2'.

You can always find the 'nth term' by using this formula:

nth term = dn + (a - d)

Where d is the difference between the terms, a is the first term and n is the term number.

e.g. 6, 11, 16, 21, ...For this sequence d = 5, a = 6

So the formula is nth term = 5n + (6 - 5)

which becomes nth term = 5n + 1

Therefore the sequence of 4,15,26,37,48 =
dn + (a -d)
11n + (4 - 11)
11n - 7



Changing Difference Sequences
What if the difference keeps changing?
3, 5, 8, 12, 17

Obviously these are more difficult but once again we can use a formula!

nth term = a + (n - 1)d + ½(n - 1)(n - 2)c

This time there is a letter c which stands for the second difference (or the difference between the differences and d is just the difference between the first two numbers.

Putting the right numbers into the formula is reasonably simple (once you've learnt the formula!). Simplifying it requires good Algebra skills so practice your Algebra!

Here's an example:
2   3   6    11   18
  1   3    5     7
     2    2    2

Here the difference between the first two numbers is 1 so d = 1

Also the second differences are 2 so c = 2 The first term is 2 so a = 2

Using the formula, nth term = 2 + (n - 1)x1 + ½(n - 1)(n - 2)x2

Getting rid of brackets (and noticing that ½ x 2 = 1):

nth term = 2 + n - 1 + n2 - 3n + 2


Simplifying,

nth term = n2 - 2n + 3

nth term = (c/2)n2 + dn - (c3/2)n + a + c - d
